# Welcome to Ylift's Take Home Challenge
### Objective
Create a basic to-do list application using Node and Express with your choice of a frontend framework from scratch.

Recommended time limit: 4hrs 
Due by: 06/02/22 Thursday 5pm

### Tasks
Implement using:
Frontend: your choice of framework(Vue.js, React.js, or Angular)
Backend: Express, (MySQL or Mongo)

1. Implement CRUD operations- user should be able to add, read, update and delete todos
2. Dockerize the application into seperate containers using docker-compose to run the multi-container application

#### Example File structure: 
📂 project
 ┣ 📜 docker-compose.yml
 ┗ 📂 client
    ┣ 📜 .dockerignore
    ┣ 📜 Dockerfile
    ┣ 📂 src
    ┗ 📜 package.json
 ┗ 📂 server
    ┣ 📜 .dockerignore
    ┣ 📜 Dockerfile
    ┣ 📂 src
    ┗ 📜 package.json
    
### Initializing the Project
Fork and clone the GitHub link to a local folder in your computer. Open the folder using VSCode or any text editor of your choice.

#### Note
> You are NOT required to implement an authentication system. Assume each request is coming from the same user. Assume the API is only consumed by you and your own application.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Node and framework of your choice best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Readme documentation - can I get it set up and running
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
##### Dont worry about
 - Making the frontend pretty
